1. Save bam file to your bin subdirectory within SPAdes-3.11.1
2. Execute the file with: bash multi_kmer.sh
3. You will be prompted to type in your file name (Note: you cannot use tab to prepopulate your file name, so it may be beneficial to rename your files prior to running them if you are concerned about typos)
4. Hit Enter - the script will automatically run through all 14 kmer lengths that are currently being established
5. Once complete, the screen will display your kmer lengths and the longest contig for each kmer length. This data is also saved within the main folder for this analysis as lengths.txt
